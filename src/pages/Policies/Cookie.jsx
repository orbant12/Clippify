When you return to that website (or visit websites that use the same cookies) these websites recognize the cookies and your browsing device.</h6>

         <div>
            <h6>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We also use technologies which are similar to cookies, such as web beacons/pixels, log files and mobile device identifiers.</h6>

         <div>
            <h6><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Web beacons/Pixels/Gifs:</span> Web beacons (also called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”) are invisible picture files/small portions of code that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize users when providing the Services. Web beacons collect information such as a record of the page on which they are placed and a timestamp. We use web beacons to track the online usage patterns of our users and in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients, which helps us measure the success of our marketing campaigns. We also use web beacons placed by third party advertisers to track whether you have clicked on the adverts they have placed and to measure success. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair the functionality of these technologies.</h6>

Cookies can tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Website before or whether you are a new visitor. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</h6>

These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by the Website, for example, to recognise your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.</h6>

         </div>
         <div>
            <h6>We use cookies on this site to make sure you can use the Website easily and enjoy the Website. Some of these cookies are essential and we cannot provide our service without them, but there are others that can be turned off (depending on the device you use). Note that, depending on the type of device you have, it may not be possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms. For some tracking technologies, you may also not have the ability to specifically reject or disable tracking. However, in many instances these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair the functionality of these technologies. In addition, note that disabling cookies and/or similar technologies prevents Canva or its business partners from tracking your browser’s activities in relation to the Service, and for use in targeted advertising activities by Canva, including via third party websites. It also disables many of the features available through the Service.</h6>
