Web beacons collect information such as a record of the page on which they are placed and a timestamp. We use web beacons to track the online usage patterns of our users and in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients, which helps us measure the success of our marketing campaigns. We also use web beacons placed by third party advertisers to track whether you have clicked on the adverts they have placed and to measure success. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair the functionality of these technologies.</h6>
