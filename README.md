## Problems and Solutions

### 1. ASR Network only accept mp3 / wav files

To solve this problem, I needed to convert a copy of the mp4 to mp3 and upload it to the storage as two seperate files with the same ID (ID.mp4, ID.mp3). For this solution I have made the storage architecture so every user has his own file named with his UID with these inside - userID/FolderID/FileID/ where ID.mp4, ID.mp3, ID.transcript will take place.

### 2. CORS Isolation for SharedArrayBuffer 

After considering the limitations, I have decided to use CORS Isolation to be able to use FFmpeg for trimming, converting, timeline bar and thubnail extraction.

### 3. CORS Isolated Storage Access

Needed to manually edit Google Console's header's

### 4. Rich Text Editor State Extraction for Cross Platform Accessability

Lexical Editor has nummerous extraction methods that is why I choose this technology. Lexical allowed me to extract the content into JSON

### 5. Youtube URL Downloader - MUST move from serverless to REST

I used
