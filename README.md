## Key Achievements

1. **Mastery of FFMPEG Syntax:** Proficient in manipulating media files (mp3, mp4, blob, blob64, URL, data URL) using FFMPEG, showcasing a deep understanding of multimedia processing.

2. **Self-trained Neural Network for Video Transcript Extraction:** Built a neural network using TensorFlow and Numpy for video transcript extraction, demonstrating expertise in machine learning and natural language processing.

3. **OpenAI API Implementation:** Successfully integrated the OpenAI API to create a ChatBot, showcasing proficiency in leveraging external APIs for advanced functionality.

4. **Authentication and User Data Flow with Firebase:** Implemented secure user authentication and managed data flow using Firebase, ensuring a robust and scalable user management system.

5. **Live Database with Firebase Changes on Snapshot:** Developed a dynamic system that reflects real-time changes in the Firebase database, demonstrating skills in live data synchronization.

6. **Lexical Editor for Rich Text Editor State Management:** Created a lexical editor for managing rich text editor states, showcasing expertise in front-end development and state management.

7. **Stripe API Integration:** Implemented Stripe API for payment processing, including setup, proper JSON data fetching, and secure storage of payment information for features like invoices, prices, and subscription states.

8. **Plain CSS Styling: ** Each Page has its own .css file, layout, and position made with flexbox, components styling written inside the page where the component is placed, there are two types of color themes. (#dark, #light) 

10. **Own Policies and Terms of Use:** Drafted and implemented custom policies and terms of use, highlighting a commitment to legal and ethical considerations in software development.
